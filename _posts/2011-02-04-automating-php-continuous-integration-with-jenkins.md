![](/images/butler.png "Jenkins")If you were at the [PHP Benelux conference](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2011/) last weekend, you probably saw several talks, including [mine](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2011/talks/#mertictools), that mentioned using [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) as a Continuous Integration server. For those of you looking to tackle setting up Jenkins for your PHP projects, I just came across this [blog post](http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/907-http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/907-Template-for-Jenkins-Jobs-for-PHP-Projects.html) from Sebastian Bergman, creator of PHPUnit and thought leader in the PHP community when it comes to testing in PHP. In the post, he announced his [new open source project](http://jenkins-php.org/) to create a standardized template for PHP projects running under Jenkins. The template integrates the popular PHP testing tools of [PHP\_Codesniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/redirected), [phpcpd](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd), [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/), [PHP\_Depend](http://pdepend.org/), [phpmd](http://phpmd.org/), and [phploc](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phploc), and he provides a guide for getting up and running with [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) with ease.
