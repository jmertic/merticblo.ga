I finally have the updates to the PHP Manual for using the new installer, check it out at [http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.installer.msi.php](http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.installer.msi.php "http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.installer.msi.php"). It goes into advanced usage for command line installations and the various options you have when doing one. A definite must read if you want to deploy PHP via Group Policies or a silent installation.

Thanks to the phpdoc team for letting me add this documentation ( and special thanks to Nuno Lopes for ( patiently ) helping me get the documentation correctly formatted ).
