[![phpnw10 PHP Conference 09/10/2010](/images/small_details_174x100.png "phpnw10 PHP Conference 09/10/2010")](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw10/)I'm excited to announce I'll be speaking at [PHPNW Conference](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw10/), to be held October 9th, 2010 in Manchester, UK. I'll be doing my talk, "[Developing Easily Deployable PHP Applications](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw10/developing-easily-deployable-php-applications)", which I also did in July at OSCON. I'm working on making the talk even better based upon feedback IÂ received, and will talk more about the various tools we use and have developed to make building SugarCRM easier.

This is my first time to this conference, but judging from the [lineup of talks](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw10/schedule/) it is not one to miss if you are in the area. The lineup has several exciting talks about PHP development from some of the biggest names in PHP. You can register now at the [conference website](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw10/registration/); early bird registration ends on September 4th.
