It's almost been a year now since the first testing release the of the installer came out ( [http://news.php.net/php.internals/24929](http://news.php.net/php.internals/24929 "first post to internals") ). I would like to thank everyone who has used and provided feedback on it; as my first real contribution to PHP and Open Source in general, it has been a very rewarding experience.

I am always looking for any suggestions for improvements to the installer. I'm also curious how people are using it; is it just for personal development, or is there anyone using it to deploy to a group of desktops or servers?

I'll be wandering around at OSCON in two weeks, mostly in the PHP tracks. If you are using the installer, I'd like to meet you and hear any feedback you may have.
