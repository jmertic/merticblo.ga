As I get ready to head to OSCON tomorrow, I almost forgot about to post about [LinuxTag 2010](http://www.linuxtag.org/) last month which I gave my "[SugarCRM - Your next business application framework](http://www.linuxtag.org/2010/en/program/free-conference/popup/details.html?talkid=131)" talk. I posted a wrap-up piece over on the [Sugar Developer Blog](http://developers.sugarcrm.com/wordpress/2010/06/18/sugarcrm-and-linuxtag-2010/) about the event, talking about my talk as well as the keynote given by [SugarCRM CEO Larry Augustin](http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/about/leadership.html#LarryAugustin). It was a great trip, I was able to visit the city and got to meetup with several SugarCRM partners, as well as fellow PHPer [Pierre Joye](http://blog.thepimp.net/). Thanks to the LinuxTag crew for the invite and for putting on a terrific show.

For those of you in Portland this week, be sure to stop by [my session at 5:20pm on Thursday in Portland 251](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/12992) to learn about what we at SugarCRM have done to enable our application to be deployed on multiple different stacks. And I look forward to meeting up with anyone in the Sugar community that will be at the event.
