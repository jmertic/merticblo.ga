I've just uploaded the slides from my [confoo.ca](http://confoo.ca) talk ["Making software management tools work for you"](http://confoo.ca/en/2010/session/making-software-management-tools-work-for-you). You can download the slides from [here](http://jmertic.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/confoo-ca-2010-making-software-management-tools-for-you.pdf).

Thanks again to everyone who attended! Please give me feedback on [joind.in](http://joind.in/1302).
