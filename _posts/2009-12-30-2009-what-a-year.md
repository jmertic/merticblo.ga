Looking back on 2009, I can say that this has been quite a year for me and my family this year. Just to name a few things:

- Celebrated 2 years at [SugarCRM](http://www.sugarcrm.com)
- Wrote my first book, [The Definitive Guide to SugarCRM](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430224398/ref=cm_rdp_product)
- Started speaking at several different conferences; SugarCon, DC PHP Conference, and the [Ontario GNU Linuxfest](http://onlinux.ca/node/119).
- Began the process of an international adoption from South Korea with [Spence-Chapin](http://www.spence-chapin.org/).

I'm looking forward to an even more prosperous and rewarding 2010, including [speaking at Confoo.ca](http://www.confoo.ca/en/2010/session/making-software-management-tools-work-for-you) in March, more writing, welcoming a new child into our home, and turning the big three-oh :-P. Happy New Year to everyone!
