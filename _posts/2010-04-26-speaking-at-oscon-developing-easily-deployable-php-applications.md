I am thrilled to announce that I'll be speaking at [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010) this year, debuting a new and exciting talk "[Developing Easily Deployable PHP Applications](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/12992)". Read more about it on my announcement on the [Sugar Developer Blog](http://developers.sugarcrm.com/wordpress/2010/04/26/see-developing-easily-deployable-php-applications-at-oscon-this-summer-in-portland/).![](/images/oscon2010_12year.png "OSCON")

OSCON is my favorite conference to go to; I've attended twice in the past and always have been blown away by the vast open source community that comes out to participate. It was also one of the first conferences I ever attended, waaaay back in 2005, so it's rather surreal to now be speaking here. Plus, it's in Portland, and who doesn't like Portland :-). I look forward to meeting up with fellow Sugar, PHP, and open source community members there...
