Thanks everyone who came to my talk today at [PHPBenelux](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2011/), "[Making Software Management tools work for you](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2011/talks/#mertictools)". It was a great turnout, and I look forward to feedback on my talk on [joind.in](http://joind.in/2417).Â Below is my slide deck, hosted by slideshare.

Thanks to the conference organizers for inviting me to come; I plan on posting a review on my blog once I'm back in the states.
