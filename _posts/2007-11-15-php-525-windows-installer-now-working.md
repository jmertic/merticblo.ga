Thanks to a missed CVS commit, [Bug # 43230](http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=43230) came up b0rking the installer last week. I rebuilt it and updated it at [http://www.php.net/downloads.php](http://www.php.net/downloads.php) ( with big thanks to Derick Rethans for the karma and help finding my way to get it updated ).

Sorry for all the confusion and problems this has caused.
