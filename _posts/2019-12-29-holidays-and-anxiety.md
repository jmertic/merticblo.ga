The holiday season can be a great period of enjoyment, relaxation, and winding down over a long year. But it can also bring out trauma and anxiety. 

Why is it that polar opposite emotions happen? I found this [article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/women-s-mental-health-matters/201512/anxiety-makes-the-holidays-harder) which shared some great first hand insight into the challenges, such as:

- Changes to the daily routine
- Being around different groups of people that you might not see often
- Pressures on expectations for the holidays ( like gift giving )
- In many areas, the weather tends to be gloomy and dark, which invokes conditions like Seasonal Affective Disorder
- Memories of past holidays that were traumatic or loved ones no longer around.

Making the holidays less stressful and intimidating can help lower the anxiety, such as:

- If you are hosting a holiday get together, have multiple spaces for guests that include quiet spaces.
- Have no gift or gift spend limits to not have financial pressures on folks.
- If you are serving food, ensure you have variety in food groups and dietary needs so folks aren't pressured to eat food they may not be comfortable with.
