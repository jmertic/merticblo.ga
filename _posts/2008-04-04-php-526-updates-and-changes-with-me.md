The new PHP 5.2.6 release will feature automatic configuration of the [NetServe Web Server](http://www.netxsolutions.co.uk/) thanks to help from James at Net-X Solutions. There also will be some bug fixes in the area of FastCGI configuration, Vista support, and extension configuration.

I've also changed jobs recently, starting at [SugarCRM](http://www.sugarcrm.com) back in December as a Software Engineer. Big thanks to [Travis Swicegood](http://www.travisswicegood.com) for helping me find this amazing opportunity.
