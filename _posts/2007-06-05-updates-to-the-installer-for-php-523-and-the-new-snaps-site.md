No major user-visible changes were made for this release, but all the problems people had with configuring IIS and Apache should have gone away with this release. I've made some changes to the builder so that it supports an installer for PHP 6, which should appear on [snaps.php.net](http://snaps.php.net "snaps.php.net") soon.

Speaking of [snaps.php.net](http://snaps.php.net "snaps.php.net") , be sure to check out the re-design of the site. It's much cleaner, uses the PHP styles, and lists the PHP Windows Installers snapshot builds. Thanks to Edin for plugging in the backend code and everyone on internals with comments and suggestions.
