I am thrilled to announce that I will be speaking this March at the [4th annual Palmetto Open Source Software Conference in Columbia, SC](http://www.posscon.org/). It's my first time to the conference, and I'm really excited to be a part of it. During the conference, I'll be doing two talks.[![](images/posscon_logo_trans.png "POSSCON 2011")](http://www.posscon.org/)

- "Developing Easily Deployable PHP Applications" will be featured on the [technical track](http://www.posscon.org/technical2011), which is a talk centering around all the things we do at Sugar to build an app that deployed on several different platforms.
- "SugarCRM - Your next business application framework" will be featured on the [leadership track](http://www.posscon.org/leadership2011), and will talk about using SugarCRM as a platform for building business applications.
