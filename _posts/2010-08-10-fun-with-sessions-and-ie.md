I just added a blog post on the [Sugar Developer Blog about Sessions and IE](http://developers.sugarcrm.com/wordpress/2010/08/10/sessions-and-ie/), detailing one quirky idiosyncrasy with how Internet Explorer won't save sessions if the server name isn't of the proper form. An issue for ages, but one worth bringing up in case you haven't had to spend an entire day trying to figure it out :-).

Enjoy!
